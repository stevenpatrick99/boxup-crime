Box Up Kids is a fun and innovative after school club designed to uniquely motivate and inspire young children aged 4-11, whilst keeping them fit & strong. Through our engagement of non-contact boxing, kids are able to explore the discipline and the art boxing provides.

Our inspiring mentors complement the program by creating an encouraging atmosphere in order to build upon their confidence from a tender age. Two staff members deliver these sessions. The first staff member is a qualified boxing tutor, teaching students the art of boxing whilst assisting them with nutritional advice, and ensuring students have optimum fitness and wellbeing. The second staff member is a Box Up Kids mentor, delivering mentoring sessions, which allow students to go through personal development as well as self- esteem and confidence building programmes.
