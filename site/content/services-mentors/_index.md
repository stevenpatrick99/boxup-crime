<h1 class="b">Gang Prevention and Intervention Programs<h1>

Our flexible programs have been commissioned by the Mayor’s Office. That means we’ve been able to work with young offenders in Barking & Dagenham, with access to agencies including the probation services and young offenders’ services. We’ve got a proven track record of not only getting in touch with hard-to-reach young people, but in helping them move on from gang life.

We also understand that leaving a gang is only the start, which is why we offer support that goes beyond the immediate problem. Through our programme, ex-gang members have access to job opportunities, qualifications, training and business start-up mentoring.

Together, we can deliver a knockout blow to gang culture and criminality. Contact us today to find out more about these programs and the work we deliver.
